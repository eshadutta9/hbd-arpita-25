        <p><b>Dearest Arpita, </br>
        We have been friends for the entire duration of our adult lives-- a figure that is way bigger than I am comfortable admitting. I am sure we will be friends for much, much longer. In this duration, I have stopped caring about most things I used to care about when I was younger. For instance, I don't care about fancy displays of affection anymore. You know I love you. I don't care how far apart we live. We are in each others thoughts. I don't care what people say. I don't care what people do. I don't care who you are. I don't care where you're from. I don't care what you do. 
        </br>
        As long as you love me.
        </br> - Esha
