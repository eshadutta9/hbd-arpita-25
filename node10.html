        <p><b>To Arpita on her 25th birthday,
        I wish that someday I can be as resilient, brave, and expressive as you. I have never known anyone to face as much as you have and yet continue to bring so much happiness to people around them. You're fiercely loyal, beautiful inside out, and outrageously funny. You're one of a kind. Taylor Swift wrote Enchanted for you only.</br> 
        You may think God does not love you but she brought us all together, and I can't think of a better blessing than that.</br>
